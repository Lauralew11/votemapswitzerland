This is a version of the famous visualization [«Land doesn't vote, people do»](https://themorningnews.org/p/the-history-of-the-map-behind-land-doesnt-vote-people-do) by [Karim Douïeb](https://twitter.com/karim_douieb) for Switzerland written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). It shows the results of the popular initiative [«For responsible businesses – protecting human rights and the environment»](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20201129/iniziativa-popolare-per-imprese-responsabili-a-tutela-dell-essere-umano-e-dell-ambiente.html) at municipal level.
